# A guided project from Datacamp using R

## [1. Handwashing]()
This project practice analyzing the data that made Semmelweis discover the importance of handwashing. It starts with examining the death rates from childbed fever among women who were giving birth by several basic data manipulation and data visualization tools. Then I used graphs to examine the effect of handwashing on death rates after it was introduced. Finally, I make conclusion about the effectiveness of handwashing.
